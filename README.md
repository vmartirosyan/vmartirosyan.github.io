# Neural Network Demos - GitHub Pages

This directory contains a client-side implementation of polynomial neural networks that can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Features

### Currently Available
- **Single Digit Recognition**: Draw digits (0-9) and watch the AI recognize them instantly
  - 10 specialized binary classifiers working in ensemble
  - ~5ms inference time
  - ~84% accuracy on MNIST test data
  - 100% client-side (no server required)

### Coming Soon
- Multi-digit recognition
- Face recognition
- Movement detection

The interactive CV is hosted in the separate [`vmartirosyan/cv`](https://github.com/vmartirosyan/cv)
repository and published as a project page at `/cv/cv.html`.

## 🌐 Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: Deploy from this directory

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select branch: `polynomial`
   - Set folder: `/github_pages`
   - Save

2. **Wait for deployment**: GitHub will automatically deploy your site

3. **Access**: Your site will be available at `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/`

### Option 2: Deploy from root with subtree

```bash
# Create a gh-pages branch with only the github_pages content
git subtree push --prefix github_pages origin gh-pages

# Then in GitHub settings:
# - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
# - Select branch: gh-pages
# - Set folder: / (root)
```

## 🛠️ Local Development

To test locally before deploying:

```bash
# Navigate to the github_pages directory
cd github_pages

# Start a simple HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx http-server -p 8000

# Open browser to http://localhost:8000
```

**Important**: You MUST use a local web server. Opening `index.html` directly in a browser won't work due to CORS restrictions when loading the model files.

## 📦 Model Files

The `models/` directory contains 10 binary neural network files:
- `digit_0_sparse.bin` through `digit_9_sparse.bin`
- Total size: ~12MB
- These will be downloaded once by users' browsers and cached

Each model is a sparse polynomial neural network trained to recognize a specific digit using:
- First-order terms (linear)
- Second-order terms (quadratic)
- 3x3 neighborhood features (9th-order)
- 5x5 neighborhood features (25th-order)
- Cross features (3-length and 5-length)

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding More Demos

The `index.html` is designed to be easily extensible. To add a new demo:

1. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `new-feature.html`)
2. Create corresponding CSS in `css/`
3. Add JavaScript logic in `js/`
4. Update `index.html` to add a demo card:

```html
<div class="demo-card">
    <div class="demo-icon">🎯</div>
    <h2>Your Feature</h2>
    <p>Description here</p>
    <div class="demo-stats">
        <span class="stat-badge">✓ Feature 1</span>
    </div>
    <a href="new-feature.html" class="demo-button">Try Demo →</a>
</div>
```

### Styling

All styles use CSS custom properties and can be easily customized by modifying the color schemes in the CSS files:
- Primary gradient: `#667eea` to `#764ba2`
- Adjust these colors throughout the CSS for a different theme

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Neural Network Architecture

The implementation uses a custom sparse polynomial neural network architecture:

- **Input**: 28×28 grayscale images (784 pixels)
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize to [0, 2] range
- **Features**:
  - Linear terms: 784 coefficients
  - Quadratic terms: ~307K coefficients (sparse)
  - Spatial features: neighborhoods and crosses
- **Output**: Single value (distance from target)
- **Classification**: Ensemble voting across 10 networks

### Browser Compatibility

- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses standard Web APIs (Canvas, Fetch, ArrayBuffer)
- No external dependencies

## 🐛 Issues and Contributions

If you find issues or want to contribute:
1. Report issues on the main repository
2. Submit pull requests to the `polynomial` branch
3. Test locally before submitting

## 📊 Performance

- **Model loading**: ~200-500ms (one-time, then cached)
- **Inference time**: ~5ms per digit
- **Model size**: 12MB total (1.2MB per digit classifier)
- **Accuracy**: ~84% on MNIST test set

## 🔐 Privacy

All computation happens in your browser. No data is sent to any server. The models are downloaded once and cached by your browser.
